# Diabetes ML Classification

This repository contains a machine learning project that applies and compares different classification algorithms on the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**.  
The goal is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on medical features and to evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

## 🚀 Models Implemented
- Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with hyperparameter tuning
- Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning
- AdaBoost with hyperparameter tuning
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with hyperparameter tuning

## ⚙️ Features
- Data preprocessing
- Train-test split
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Comparison of model performance

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

## 📁 Files
- `diabetes_classification_models.ipynb` → Main notebook with experiments
